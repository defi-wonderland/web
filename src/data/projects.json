No one would willingly make every bank payment visible to the world, yet this remains the norm on Ethereum today. For broader adoption, privacy must be a built-in feature, not an optional layer. However, integrating privacy is still complex: developers face fragmented tools, advanced cryptography requirements, and disjointed user experiences. This complexity slows innovation and limits user trust. The technology exists to change this but wallets must evolve to make privacy seamless and native to the on-chain experience."
