              We started as a small group of activists with diverse backgrounds.
              Coding, Big Data, Finance and VC are our cup of tea.
            </PrimaryText>

            <SecondaryText>
              We met while collaborating with several DeFi protocols in the
              early days and decided to join forces into one organization that
              would let us scale and make a much bigger impact which would
              become DeFi Wonderland.

              We currently work as an activist fund but we share the ethos of
              the ecosystem, creating much more value than the one we take: we
              grow projects, communities, markets in a more decentralized and
              self-sustainable manner, only proffiting when the value we add is
              exponentially higher than the one weâ€™ll extract.

              We're value creators, always seeking to understand the ecosystem

              We believe DeFi is mind boggling and will open an array of
              possibilities all around the world, but especially for people that
              have been left behind by the current financial system.

              We will help DeFi achieve scale through our code.
