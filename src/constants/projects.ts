      'Keep3r Network v2 is a decentralized and permissionless network that provides DevOps services for projects. The network has been rebuilt from scratch with improved code quality, reduced gas usage, optimized tokenomics, and added automatic credit mining. Currently, it is deployed on the Mainnet and will soon be available on EVM-compatible sidechains and L2s. Some of the popular projects already using the Keep3r Network protocol include MakerDAO, Yearn, Phuture Finance, and others.',

      'This mechanism provides the price history of Uniswap V3 pools to chains where the pair may not be available or has insufficient liquidity. This is achieved by creating a virtual Uniswap V3 pool with bridged data from the Mainnet. The team was responsible for the architecture design, off-chain scripts, and smart contract development. The mechanism has recently been launched and is already working on Optimism and Polygon.',

    description:
      "Smock is a testing framework for Hardhat that is used by around 800 repositories. It is a Solidity mocking library and a plugin for Hardhat that allows developers to create mock Solidity contracts using JavaScript or TypeScript. Smock makes it easier to test smart contracts and eliminates the need to write mock contracts in Solidity. Smock is inspired by sinon, sinon-chai, and Python's unittest.mock and currently only works with Hardhat. However, the team plans to extend support to other testing frameworks like Truffle in the future.",
