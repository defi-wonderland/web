# Liveness 2 and beyond

# Goal

**This report aims to improve the safety and scalability of the SAFE liveness module. We will analyze different methods for on-chain storage proof verification and discuss concrete improvements for the module.**

# The Liveness problem

Let’s first recap the problem we are trying to solve with the Liveness Module. This context will be valuable for analyzing what each verification method can provide.

Unlike EOAs, smart wallets have configuration settings, which can cause synchronization problems across chains. Consequently, SAFEs on different chains function as separate contracts, even though they may share the same address and configuration parameters during deployment. This problem becomes critical when there’s a change in the owners’ list. We must tackle this issue if we want to create a chain-agnostic future.

Moreover, as web3 moves towards a multichain future, the liveness problem becomes increasingly more noticeable and complex.

- Noticeable: user experience is becoming increasingly fragmented with the number of chains.
- Complex: simple solutions, such as sending cross-chain messages with a bridge, become unsustainable.

We are building the Liveness Module for SAFE to make liveness more efficient and scalable.

# Current design

We have first designed a functional PoC for the Liveness Module. You can find the design details on the [grant application](https://app.charmverse.io/safe-grants-program/page-19468196994649234) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3nxKWYucaDaDsKHyTmpyjC/Safe-Liveness?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=QY4SHW673zDAGVGw-1). One critical design choice was introducing a **Shared Proof** mechanism. We will briefly describe next what this mechanism is about.

### **Shared Proofs**

We want to update settings (a storage value) cross-chain. The trust-minimized approach involves on-chain cryptographic proofs. To prove some _settings_ of a wallet contract in a target chain are in sync with a [Home Chain](https://www.notion.so/732880952aea420dbeaa6b31bc68e490?pvs=21), a user must verify that:

1. The Home Chain’s most recent state includes a storage root *R*.
2. The _settings_ are included in _R_.

The verification can be done using **Storage Proofs:**

[Storage Proofs](https://www.notion.so/Storage-Proofs-8f5ad324afab4592b7f2882b8cf9a354?pvs=21)

![DALL·E 2023-11-01 15.54.49 - In an epic, dark, and magical setting, Alice from Alice in Wonderland is depicted designing a complex machine. The young girl, with her long blonde ha.png](https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00%2F187d98c8-b4d0-4c41-9ff1-86a2d68b1baa%2FDALLE_2023-11-01_15.54.49_-_In_an_epic_dark_and_magical_setting_Alice_from_Alice_in_Wonderland_is_depicted_designing_a_complex_machine._The_young_girl_with_her_long_blonde_ha.png?table=block&id=0336ee00-46cc-4522-82d2-cdba8365d7d2&spaceId=7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

With the current architecture, each wallet contract has to do a separate proof for step 1, as storage root varies from safe to safe. We can, however, modify the contract architecture to make users share this verification step using a Shared Contract root.

There are several ways to achieve this, but for the PoC, we will build a contract that mirrors the storage data from all safes. With this, the root _R_ is simply the storage root from a contract that contains all the owner and setting information from every SAFE using the module in a _Home chain_. Whenever users create or modify their settings, the S4M should be updated correspondingly.

The crucial insight here is computation compression: users can share the first verification step; thus, instead of confirming the storage of only their SAFE wallet against the Home Chain's state root, they can assert the root of the shared contract. Users can then perform the second verification against the verified storage root.

### **Home Chain**

For the PoC, and despite its high cost, we suggest using Ethereum as the primary reference point due to its security and ability to communicate with other chains. However, as things change, other options might become more suitable. That’s why we use the generic term’ Home Chain’ to refer to this main reference point.

<aside>
💡 Why do we need a reference point?
Users should update settings only from the Home Chain to avoid confusion about the most updated state.

</aside>

Using Ethereum as the Home chain has an additional advantage: proof verification happens in other chains only. This means we don’t need to worry too much about gas costs, as most chains have low gas prices.

However, we expect to enable users to set their own Home Chain eventually. This would also mean that high gas costs become a problem. Here is where this research comes into play. The report will analyze different systems that can help make this verification process more efficient and scalable.

# The EVM as the verifier

![DALL·E 2023-11-01 15.08.38 - Create a dark and epic illustration featuring Alice from Alice in Wonderland and Bob, depicted as a medieval knight. In this mystical forest setting, .png](https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00%2F753d0eff-efac-4892-9130-b99a1ce74e7e%2FDALLE_2023-11-01_15.08.38_-_Create_a_dark_and_epic_illustration_featuring_Alice_from_Alice_in_Wonderland_and_Bob_depicted_as_a_medieval_knight._In_this_mystical_forest_setting_.png?table=block&id=b355fd22-12e6-4da6-8660-67b3fd20f428&spaceId=7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

Ethereum is a transparent and decentralized VM. As such, it is the ideal platform to act as a trustless verifier. If Ethereum is convinced, so should we. But what does it mean for Ethereum to be a verifier? Verification in a protocol is a series of deterministic steps conducted on a series of inputs. In particular, we can write a verification program in the bytecode of a Smart Contract.

To enable any trustless method based on storage proofs, we need two things:

- State root availability
- Verification method

## State root availability

Designing a trustless method to post the Home chain state root is far beyond the scope of the PoC, but as the whole system design is sensible to it, it’s essential to understand how it works. Doing so will allow us to pick the most secure option as an oracle for the module.

**Cross-chain posting**

To execute the whole verification, we need a reliable way to read the state root from the Home Chain. Light Client Proofs do not prove execution or storage but consensus (validator signatures) and use the beacon root (instead of the state root). These proofs assert that a specific state root *R* corresponds to a finalized block. In other words, a proof must prove that a particular state is valid and corresponds to the correct (finalized) fork choice. Unfortunately, the beacon root is currently not included in the execution layer, but [it's expected to](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788) be. So, how do we get this information to another chain?

One basic method to prove the consensus of chain A in the execution layer of chain B is to run an on-chain Light Client of A in B. This is, of course, extremely expensive to run. To gain some intuition on why, consider that Ethereum consensus uses BLS signatures on a BLS12-381 curve, which are not included as a precompile in EVMs. Even if the Light Client verified the signatures of the [sync committee](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/altair/sync-protocol.md#introduction) only, it is still prohibitory costly. Here is where zk comes into play.

[Succint](https://www.succinct.xyz/) developed a [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaa1383ee33c81ef2274419dd5e0ea5cce4baf6cc#code) that verifies a zk-proof of consensus, where anyone can post a zkSNARK attesting that the sync committee has signed a block header. Their design also requires keeping track of the current sync committee, which is also done via a zkSNARK. The protocol is deployed on Ethereum and other chains, but the light client updates is operating [frequently only in Goerli](https://explorer.telepathy.xyz/). Each update in Ethereum costs [300k in gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6d608c89eb97b249f40fc1db4306fe0b5af4d0dec3e1db1b8872b3ddf8c5af75). They enable light client proofs of Ethereum and Gnosis to Ethereum, Gnosis, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance, Optimism and Polygon (look [here](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/resources/contract-addresses) for the addresses).

[Bravis](https://brevis.network/) is using a similar [sync committee model](https://docs.brevis.network/zk-implementation/zk-light-client), but couldn’t find the light client contracts to figure out their gas cost.

Conversely, [Lagrange](https://www.lagrange.dev/) questions the security of a sync-committee-based light client (such as the one used by Succint), as they are exposed to [corruption risk](https://lagrange-labs.gitbook.io/lagrange-labs/overview/overview-of-existing-cross-chain-security-models). Moreover, they claim that it’s impossible to maintain a zkSNARK system that proves Casper Finality (Succint claims their SNARK include finality, so one of the two must be lying). To safely and efficiently update the finalized block header information, they use a node’s network restaked (using Eigenlayer or other providers). This method also allows integrating other chains that don’t necessarily have Ethereum consensus. They are still on production.

[Herodotus](https://www.herodotus.dev/) is another key protocol here. They use native L1<>L2 message passing to synchronize block hashes between chains. The process is quite complex, involving multiple transactions over two contracts (full explanation can be found [here](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/protocol-design/historical-block-hash-accumulator/initial-accumulation-event)). The total gas consumed is almost 4M ([here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbce801a066b3c522eb8817b352b08eaf5d04293c60e328500469495b42e60f19) and [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa70b41ebf2243ca1825b5e873cb081dba93806703c7b5fe4e84c8078e86faa10)).

It’s worth noticing that L2s can post the `BLOCKHASH` from L1 directly on L2 by using a deposit function, as an arbitrary message. This needs to be actively supported, and none is doing it at the time of writing, as the cost would be pretty high (approximately $300k per rollup per year). Nonetheless, there is no need to update every single root: time batching could do wonders on saving unnecessary costs. Shared sequencer could also address this problem.

An alternative design would be to modify the client from the L2 and introduce an opcode/precompile that can access the `BLOCKHASH` directly without a deposit (leverage the fact that the sequencer is already reading the L1 state).

**Historical roots**

_Disclaimer_: This is not required for our module, but it’s an essential part of the protocols discussed in the next section. Moreover, this problem could become relevant to our module eventually.

The EVM allows contracts to fetch `BLOCKHASH` data up to 256 blocks back (less than 1 hour). This is not enough to make storage proofs of things like “who owned a certain ERC20 2 months ago?”, which could be used for a trustless airdrop distribution.

[Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/), [Relic](https://relicprotocol.com/) and [Herodotus](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/historical-block-hash-accumulator) are working on storing these historical roots on-chain using zkSNARKs. They both have a [similar flow](https://docs.axiom.xyz/protocol-design/caching-block-hashes), where users update the latest roots with proof that a contract verifies. If the roots are valid, they get inserted into a Merkle Mountain Range. Herodotus also stores [the root cache into an MMR](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/historical-block-hash-accumulator) but cross-chain using STARKs.

<aside>
⛰️ Merkle Mountain Range

Once verified, the roots must be stored on-chain to run the other verifications (storage proofs, for instance). Nonetheless, keeping such a registry is expensive. There are several ways to optimize this point, with the most popular approach being Merkle Mountain Range structures, an efficiently updatable Merkle tree of roots (see [this explanation](https://docs.grin.mw/wiki/chain-state/merkle-mountain-range/), [Axiom implementation](https://docs.axiom.xyz/protocol-design/caching-block-hashes), the [Herodotus implementation in Cairo](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/cairo-mmr) and polytope [Solidity implementation](https://github.com/polytope-labs/solidity-merkle-trees/blob/main/src/MerkleMountainRange.sol)).

</aside>

## Verification methods

As we mentioned, our goal is to prove the value of a certain storage value from a certain contract in a different chain. There are several ways to verify this on-chain:

- generate storage proof → verify it on-chain
- generate storage proof → generate zk proof for it → verify it on-chain

During the last few years, we have seen enormous technical advances in optimizing verification processes. The field of zk proofs has gained a lot of traction, in a big part due to their brief verification step. These proofs outsource the heavy computation to the prover to make verification as simple as possible.

This *succinctness* is particularly appealing when dealing with the EVM, as computation requires gas. In what follows, we will describe some possible approaches to dealing with storage proofs in this context.

In [this blog post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/06/20/deeperdive.html), Vitalik compares there are five ways to tackle verification:

- Merkle proofs (already discussed)
- General-purpose zkSNARKs
- Special-purpose proofs (e.g. KZG)
- Verkle proofs
- Direct reading

Both zkSNARKs and KZG allow for proof aggregation, further reducing user costs.

![Untitled](https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00%2F34ba1ee8-9a01-4863-8323-960c6232a4d2%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=a34cf79b-b098-4630-a956-f966dd39c500&spaceId=7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00&width=880&userId=&cache=v2)

In what follows, we will focus on the existing approaches to tackle this verification step. Even though storage proofs (with or without zk) are the most secure method, we will also consider other options in our analysis. For each, we will analyze the tradeoffs, possibilities, costs and state of development.

### **Merkle Proofs verification**

[Storage Proofs](https://www.notion.so/Storage-Proofs-8f5ad324afab4592b7f2882b8cf9a354?pvs=21)

MPT verification refers to contracts that can compute the whole storage proof from the Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie on-chain. There are several working implementations of MPT verifiers written in Solidity. We recommend checking the [Lido](https://github.com/lidofinance/curve-merkle-oracle/blob/main/contracts/MerklePatriciaProofVerifier.sol) and [polytope](https://github.com/polytope-labs/solidity-merkle-trees/blob/main/test/MerklePatricia.t.sol) implementations.

It’s easy to generate proofs for any storage slot using the RPC providers’ [eth_getProof()](https://docs.infura.io/networks/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/eth_getproof) method. Storage-proof verification implementations require approximately 200k gas, which is considerable for Ethereum but not so much for L2s.

From the existing protocols we mentioned, [Relic](https://docs.relicprotocol.com/overview/comparison) and [Herodotus](https://www.herodotus.dev/) use direct MPT proofs against the verified roots. You can check out [Relic’sRelic’s optimized Solidity library](https://github.com/Relic-Protocol/relic-contracts/blob/main/contracts/lib/MPT.sol) and Herodotus [Fact Registry](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/architecture-overview/facts-registry) in [Starknet](https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x07c88f02f0757b25547af4d946445f92dbe3416116d46d7b2bd88bcfad65a06f). I also found this repo in Noir for Ethereum MPT verification: https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs/

We will take this approach for the PoC, as it’s the most straightforward and battle-tested solution.

### **General purpose zkProofs:** **zkSNARKs**

SNARKs are argument systems that allow anyone to verify a program satisfaction claim in a non-interactive and succint way. This means that a prover can convince a verifier that they have an input that makes a computer program output a target value with a concise and easy-to-evaluate proof.

Storage proofs are only a particular use case for SNARKs, where a proof is crafted for the MPT storage proof computation. The idea here is to embed the MPT verification into a more succint SNARK.

There are many types of SNARK implementations, each with its corresponding costs. Some popular implementations in the EVM context are [Plonky2](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/blob/main/plonky2/plonky2.pdf) (which combines PLONK with FRI into a super efficient recursive SNARK) and [UltraPLONK](https://hackmd.io/Iuu9P7S5Sca0TCoYJ-sFdA) (more battle-tested, used by zkSync and Aztec, among others).

I strongly recommend this resource for anyone interested in the subject: https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf

**Coprocessors**

[Coprocessors](https://crypto.mirror.xyz/BFqUfBNVZrqYau3Vz9WJ-BACw5FT3W30iUX3mPlKxtA) are instances that work like an off-chain VM extension that can execute heavy computation based on on-chain data. These coprocessors allow the outsource storage proofs (and other kinds of computation) from the chain and then submit a zk proof that is cheaper to verify. Notice the definition of a coprocessor is [quite vague](https://dba.xyz/do-rollups-inherit-security/), which has lead to [some discussions](https://twitter.com/jon_charb/status/1698587623843823649). Storage proofs are just a [particular use case for coprocessors](https://x.com/p_e/status/1715004957576004066?s=20) but also the most common use case.

[Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/) is the most popular player in this design space. They have a [library](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/axiom-eth/) for creating custom circuits for storage proofs. They use Halo2 arithmetization (a method to convert programs to arithmetic circuits) and KZG polynomial commitments. Users must offer a reward to initiate a query, similar to our module design.

At the time of writing, they have deployed their contracts on mainnet only. A potential integration would require deploying the contracts on the different networks, which is not that easy to do, as verification requires query access to the state roots cache ([MMR implementation](https://docs.axiom.xyz/protocol-design/caching-block-hashes)).

Also, note that the current implementation consumes above [500k gas per query answer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd617ab7f787adf64c2b5b920c251ea10cd35a952), even more than the current MPT implementations. Axiom has, of course, a lot of additional benefits, such as allowing queries to go back in time.

Then, we have [RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com/), which allows users to verify general computation written in [Rust](https://dev.risczero.com/zkvm) using [STARKs](https://dev.risczero.com/proof-system/stark-by-hand) and their [Bonsai](https://dev.risczero.com/bonsai) proving system. They also built [Zeth](https://www.risczero.com/news/zeth-release), their own block and state prover, aka a type 0 zk-rollup. In theory, the gas costs are [scalable](https://www.risczero.com/news/on-chain-verification) (around 200k in callback and 30k in request). On a similar line, [fhEVM](https://www.zama.ai/fhevm) aims to create a coprocessor for private smart contract functionalities. RISC Zero and fhEVM are still in an early stage and not production-ready.

**Batching proofs: zk MapReduce & Recproofs**

The goal is to have a proof construction method optimized for generating large-scale batch storage proofs.

zkMapReduce allows anyone to prove they’ve performed specific computations on a dataset without revealing the dataset itself or the intermediate steps. The proof has to prove the existence of the underlying data (a storage proof) and the result of a computation on it. Proofs use vector commitment schemes, making them suitable for proving distributed computation, such as SQL or MapReduce.

This method allows the merging of storage proofs from different chains into a single proof, simultaneously acting as a coprocessor for multiple chains. This is [what Lagrange uses](https://lagrange-labs.gitbook.io/lagrange-labs/zk-big-data/overview-of-the-zk-big-data-stack) to act as an [n-1 bridge](https://lagrange-labs.gitbook.io/lagrange-labs/overview/what-is-the-lagrange-protocol). The bad news is that updating existing proofs is expensive, which Lagrange’s Recproofs aim to solve.

[Recproofs](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6460ebf2b6ff254688bebf1c/64e4dd54d9198fde8d58ef44_main.pdf) are a particular Merkle-tree-based vector commitment scheme that allows proof batching for a group of leaves using recursive SNARKs. This is particularly useful for large datasets and allows efficient proof updates for MapReduce systems. To achieve this, they use folding schemes, where a set of proofs gets compacted into a single proof of proofs. What’s important to know is that this proof is O(log n) with n the number of underlying proofs. We could expect Lagrange to implement Recproofs to improve their system’s proof update process.

Lagrange is yet to be operating, so we still have yet to determine what the gas cost for this system will be for the users. Due to batching, we expect systems like this to become more relevant with the number of storage proofs.

**Other approaches**

[HyperOracle](https://www.hyperoracle.io/) defines itself as programable zkOracle. It will allow users to query any information on-chain, including state or storage proofs from Ethereum, using zk-verified methods. These proofs can also work for historical data (beyond the 256 blocks). The product is still in construction, and we could not find details on the zk tools being used, nor expected gas cost or latency.

### **Specific purpose zkProofs:** **KZG**

KZG allow the construction of efficiently updatable storage proofs.

Dankrad does a great job of summarizing KZG in [this post](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html). The basic intuition works as follows:

- Given a dataset $\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$ , it’s possible to create a polynomial $P$ such that interpolates to the dataset at the powers of the root of unity $w\ni w^N=1$ in mod $N$. The interpolation expects that $P(w)=a_1, P(w^2)=a_2,\dots P(w^N)=a_n$, and can be done using Lagrange.
- A commitment to $P$ is an elliptic curve point defined as $com(P)=P_0 * G + P_1 * S_1 + \dots + P_k * S_k$ with $G$ the generator point of the curve, $P_i$ the i-th degree coefficient of the polynomial and $S_i$ the i-th point of the trusted setup.
- To create a proof for the claim $P(z)=a$, the prover must generate a polynomial $Q=\frac{P-a}{x-z}$ , and then commit to it $com(Q)$. This polynomial is well defined if and only if $P(z)=a$.
- Verifier checks the equation $Q * (x-z)=P-a$ in the elliptic curve using pairings $e$: $e(com(Q),com(x-z)) ?= e(com(P)-com(a),com(1))$

**Efficient updates**

As we mentioned, an attractive property of KZG is that proofs can be efficiently updated: if a specific value $a_i$ wants to $a_i^*$, then the old commitment to $P$ can be updated to a commitment to $P^*$ as follows: $com(P^*)=com(P)+(a_i^*-a_i) * com(L_i)$ with $L_i$ the Lagrange polynomial that equals 1 at $w^i$ and 0 on $w^j\;\forall j\neq i$. Notice $com(L_i)$ can be precomputed by the prover ($N$ commitments). The verifier, on the other hand, will not store the commitments but can receive a KZG commitment or a Merkle proof for the set to prove correctness. Hence, this protocol enables efficient updates, which would be ideal for our concrete application.

Additionally, two KZG proofs can be merged into a single one, which would simplify our current two step verification contracts into a single one.

Implementations of KZG in Solidity are still in the [experimental stage](https://github.com/topics/kzg-commitment). Most implementations focus on its application for [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) rather than for storage proofs. Also, KZG is worth it if batching can be done, which will probably not happen for the PoC.

### Verkle Proofs

[Verkle trees](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html) are improvements over Merkle Patricia Tries for storing key-value mappings. It uses stacked Polynomial or [Inner Product](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/11/05/halo.html#background-how-do-inner-product-arguments-work) commitments. These structures are [likely to be incorporated into Ethereum as the new state tree](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip).

A SNARK can be generated for Verkle tree inclusion proofs, resulting in lower prover cost than current Merkle structures. However, implementations are still far away to consider.

### Direct Reading

It is possible to enable [static calls from L2 contracts to L1 contracts](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-layer-communication-trivially-provable-and-efficient-read-access-to-the-parent-chain/15396). This would require a special opcode or precompile in the L2. Remember that sequencers are already aware of the L1 state, as they have to track the rollup contract, so it’s mostly an implementation challenge.

Optimism has recently opened a [request for a proof of concept](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/76) on this line.

### **Consensus**

Some protocols can answer state queries using consensus instead of cryptographic verification. This method introduces a considerable amount of trust but also reduces the cost of operations and latency.

[Succint](https://www.succinct.xyz/) is [following this design choice](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/state-queries/introduction) by leveraging its [attestation network](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/state-queries/succinct-attestation-network). The product was still not ready at the time of writing, so we could not find precise information on the gas costs. We did, however, find this sentence in their [documentation](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/state-queries/succinct-attestation-network):

> Many developers rely on oracles to power liquidations or other very latency sensitive parts of their protocol. These developers want the lowest-possible latency for their oracle requests. While there have been tremendous leaps in zk proof technology, the proof generation time is still ultimately too slow for many use-cases. Also, verifying a zk proof is cheap, however for _minimized_ gas costs, verifying signatures from a network is even cheaper (generally 240k gas vs. 30k gas if our network has 15 validators). Thus many developers prefer a committee based approach for minimal latency and minimal gas costs.

We will advise against this for now, even though it could reduce enormously cost and latency because we consider it is not worth the additional security risks.

## Further Optimizations

![DALL·E 2023-11-01 16.13.12 - In this dark and epic illustration, Alice from Alice in Wonderland is portrayed working intently on a complex machine. The scene is set in a medieval-.png](https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00%2F1cce95f5-541a-467e-aca7-358f80a15a32%2FDALLE_2023-11-01_16.13.12_-_In_this_dark_and_epic_illustration_Alice_from_Alice_in_Wonderland_is_portrayed_working_intently_on_a_complex_machine._The_scene_is_set_in_a_medieval-.png?table=block&id=b3a6cb6e-9592-4322-a354-1858c7a9409e&spaceId=7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

### **Optimistic layer**

A middle ground between consensus methods and full verification is to use an optimistic system where users can request and receive a state update. This system should include a verification method with a full procedure (direct MPT or zk) in case of a dispute. Such a mechanism aims to lower the gas cost of storage proofs with only a minor increase in trust (1-N will dispute).

An optimistic layer has an additional price to pay, which is latency. The mechanism requires a long time window to ensure agents have time to dispute. The longer the time window, the safer the optimistic system, but the higher the request latency.

### Shared sequencing

Shared sequencing is one of the hottest topics in web3 at the moment. As sequencers usually play a huge role in communication between chains, it is unsurprising that a shared sequencer can optimize communication by implementing shared proofs.

This design would have a similar end goal to what Lagrange does with N-1 communication but using simpler aggregated proofs. These [thoughts](https://hackmd.io/@kalmanlajko/ByE28sYfs) are still early and being [actively discussed](https://www.umbraresearch.xyz/writings/shared-validity-sequencing).

This approach is currently out of scope from this project but could be considered if shared sequencer become a thing.

### Improve Shared Contract

The current architecture introduces a contract that mirrors the relevant settings from each Safe. This is crucial for grouping together verifications from the state root down to the storage root for the users.

A natural question arises: Is there a way to group or sort the user's data to make the system more efficient? We could think about using sharding or implementing a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR).

We might also explore options other than the storage mirror contract. An intriguing idea is to have an inbox contract that stores changes rather than the entire state. This inbox contract could do more than just update storage; it could act as a mechanism for executing cross-chain actions. Even more, if we can prove certain constraints using advanced storage proofs (like Lagrange’s), we might enable cross-chain intents.

All of this sounds amazing, but it comes with a high degree of complexity. A major challenge is figuring out how to efficiently keep track of update executions. This means that the inbox contract on the Home Chain needs a way to tell the difference between different chains, which isn't easy to do in a way that can scale with the network.

# Takeaways and improvements for the Module

![DALL·E 2023-11-01 15.59.36 - A high-resolution 4K image of Alice from Alice in Wonderland, placing the final piece onto her intricate clock-like machine, filled with cryptographic.png](https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00%2Ff8ecacf5-d864-4ed6-a959-6ed75892e15b%2FDALLE_2023-11-01_15.59.36_-_A_high-resolution_4K_image_of_Alice_from_Alice_in_Wonderland_placing_the_final_piece_onto_her_intricate_clock-like_machine_filled_with_cryptographic.png?table=block&id=af8580a2-9b39-4efd-95fe-e7094b005356&spaceId=7683bccd-1174-4689-a817-b27fd9d7ef00&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

In the above sections, we explored different cross-chain verification processes. We will now summarize the advantages and status of each for potential integration into the Liveness module.

- State root availability: the Liveness module requires the Home chain state root to fully verify. This is another **strong argument for selecting Ethereum as the Home chain**, as most protocols working on this problem attest to the Ethereum state only.

The only solution currently working and has a relatively low cost is Succint (300k gas average per update). Succint only bridges the state root to [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x107b36c2418ee56c46f1d380c370fb4f1a6ae40eade18072577d418e8ab60011), Arbitrum, Polygon, Gnosis, BSC and Avalanche. At the moment, their [operators](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/telepathy-protocol/actors) charge no fee for the update, but an on-demand integration would probably require some kind of incentive.

An alternative way of addressing this issue is using a bridge, which usually costs around 200k for these message passing. [Connext](https://bridge.connext.network/) has the upper hand regarding message security among the top candidates, as they implement Merkle verification methods on top of AMBs, instead of signature aggregations like the vast majority.
Using a bridge would also enable a second optimization: bridge the Storage root of the Mirror contract instead of the state root of Ethereum. This would allow users to save money and effort on the first verification.

For the PoC, we will bridge the Storage root. We will do this to focus on the rest of the design and because it can support more chains. We will keep monitoring the status of the newer solutions and integrate them as they become more efficient.

- Improve proof efficiency: One main point we analyzed was the proof cost. We noticed that MPT verifiers are cheaper than existing ZK single-proof implementations. There are two main approaches to reducing verification costs for the latter:
  - Updatable proofs: as we mentioned, MPT proofs need to be recomputed and rechecked from scratch every time something changes, and it doesn’t matter if it’s just one or one million SAFEs. KZG and Recproofs are two protocols that address this issue. In particular, KZG is more straightforward to implement and probably more efficient for the number of proofs we expect, while Recproofs shines for larger datasets.
  - Proof batching: some verification methods allow batching of several proofs into one. This is possible with KZG and SNARK using different methods (e.g. folding scheme).
    Currently, there are no efficient implementations for either approach in the context of storage proofs. It's out of our scope of this work to develop one.
    These proofs usually have a large cost for single executions and then scale slowly. This means that, for single proofs, MPT verification will stay the most competitive, but there is a number of proofs at which ZK methods become more efficient. For this reason, we will monitor the amount of activity on the PoC to determine if these tools are worth implementing in the future.
- Optimistic layer: One easy way to reduce verification costs with only a small trust increase is using optimistic oracles. The idea here is to trust a bonded proposer with the correct updated information and then let anyone (bonded agent) dispute the answer. In a dispute, conflict resolution involves running the complete verification. In that case, the gas cost of verification would be deducted from the losing side’s bond.

The optimistic layer would allow the exchange of two MPT verifications, which are close to 200K gas each, for a request and update, which will be cheaper. Moreover, optimistic systems can update several users simultaneously, with practically the same gas cost.

A negative factor introduced by optimistic layers is latency, as a safe system requires time for disputers to act. Latency could be a problem for the module in the case of heavy activity, which may not be the case at the beginning. What’s more, lowering the gas cost of the process can bootstrap users in the same way liquidity incentives do. We could expect a first optimization to use optimistic layers and eventually move to more advanced KZG/SNARK systems (lower latency) with aggregation when the number of users justifies the total cost.

There are currently no optimistic oracles that enable custom resolution methods. We at Wonderland are actively developing Prophet together with Optimism, which will be a framework that enables this use case. Information on the gas cost will be available soon.

It’s also possible to create a custom dispute system for this particular project, which could be more gas-efficient. The issue with that would be to bootstrap activity from bonded actors. That’s why Prophet could be a better fit, even if it means using a bit more gas.

For the PoC, we expect to work on sidechains only, meaning the total gas cost of MPT verification will not be prohibitive. Similarly to the zk-methods, an optimistic layer would make much more sense for verifying in Ethereum (Home Chains different than mainnet). Implementing said layer would be a manageable experiment for a future Home chain generalization at this point.

- Incentives design: It’s easy to see that the cost of updating is directly correlated with the frequency of updates. The more updates are requested, the less gas each user should be paying, and the more users pay for updates, the faster these will get executed.

As long as the state root is not organically available, the module (users) should also pay for this action and the shared storage root verification. The variable to tune here from our end is the amount of reward that goes to the state root update (and shared storage root verification) relative to the individual verification. The ratio should be closer to 1 (half reward for each action) when there is only a single request and asymptotically to 0 (almost everything to the individual request) as many users update.

For the PoC, there will be no fixed cost. We envision this to work like a gas-market, i.e. with its own off-chain dynamic.

- Potential ecosystem optimization: beyond improving verification methods, the ecosystem is currently discussing several architecture changes that might simplify the • problem’s scope.
  - Rollups might make the Ethereum state root available: many protocols will be interested in having state root availability for different applications, so it should not be surprising to see rollups or AMBs making this value globally available. This would allow us to reduce the costs further (or increase the frequency), as payments could be batched with different services.
  - Rollups might enable direct reading eventually, which would simplify the whole verification. Direct reading would be an enormous factor in favour of keeping Ethereum as the Home Chain, but would still require dedicated solutions for non-L2 chains.
  - Shared sequencing or data availability layers can act as a way of sharing Home chain verification among several chains, reducing the cost for each even further.
  - If implemented, Verkle tree structures will completely change (for the better) the whole verification algorithm. The module, together with many other products using storage proofs, would require a major update.
    We should stay attentive and push for these developments to optimize the Liveness module further.
- Improved Shared Contract: We have explored various potential improvements to the module regarding both proof efficiency (sharding or MMR) and features (inbox contract, with cross-chain execution and even intents).
  While these modifications introduce a considerable level of complexity, we are confident that addressing these challenges is a worthwhile endeavor. We plan to continue generating ideas and discussing these topics further once we have finalized the initial proof of concept.
